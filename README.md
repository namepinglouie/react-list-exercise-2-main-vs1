# React Exercise

## Directions:
- Fork this repo
- Clone the forked repo locally
- `npm install`
- to run the webpage use `npm run dev`


Use the data below to build the component below with React:

```javascript
const results = [
  {
    percentage: "20%",
    title: "Mobile engagement",
    description: "An AI-powered solution can reduce average handle time by 20%, resulting in cost benefits of hundreds of thousands of dollars.",
  },
  {
    percentage: "60%",
    title: "Omnichannel expectations",
    description: "60% of healthcare consumers requested out-of-pocket costs from providers ahead of care, but barely half were able to get the information.",
  },
  {
    percentage: "82%",
    title: "Shifting expectations",
    description: "82% of healthcare consumers who sought pricing information said costs influenced their healthcare decision making process."
  }
];
```

## Keep in mind...
- Start with the shell of the component using placeholder texts, then include the data.
- What is the hierarchy of components? (Which component is the parent and which is the child?)
- How can I keep my code DRY?
- How can I segment this component to be reusable?
